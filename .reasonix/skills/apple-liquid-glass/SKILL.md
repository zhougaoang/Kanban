# Apple Liquid Glass — Design Skill

You are designing in the **latest Apple visual language**: calm, premium, restrained. The goal is that a user feels "this looks like Apple" within 1.5 seconds — not through gimmicks, but through the *sum of small correct decisions*.

> One sentence: **Apple light grey-white ground + unified white surfaces + hairline dividers; glass only where layers truly overlap. Restraint is the luxury.**

## When to use
- Building any web page / component / app screen meant to feel Apple-grade (App / iOS screens: also read `app.md` for the device frame + mobile shell).
- Redesigning a UI that feels fragmented, "carded", or generic.
- The user mentions Apple, apple.com, macOS, liquid glass, 苹果风, 液态玻璃, or "clean / premium / minimal".

## The 5 philosophy rules (decide by these, in order)

1. **Unified surface > fragmented cards.** Many sibling items go on **one white panel with hairline dividers**, not a pile of separately-bordered, separately-tinted cards. Fragmentation is enemy #1.
2. **Glass is seasoning, not the dish.** `backdrop-filter` frost only where **layers actually overlap**: sticky nav, modals/popovers, colored CTA blocks. Plain content areas get solid `#fff` + soft shadow — never glass. (Web has few overlapping layers; over-glassing reads as dirty.)
3. **Restraint is luxury.** A thousand "no"s for one "yes". If whitespace and hierarchy can solve it, don't add a border, fill, icon, or number. Reject data-slop.
4. **Hierarchy from weight + size + grayscale, not color.** The body world is black-white-grey. Color is only for *accent* (one blue), *heat* (one orange), *brand/live*. Never color to fill space.
5. **Apple quality lives in details.** Negative letter-spacing on big titles, `tabular-nums` numbers, hairline dividers, gentle hover lift, 180%-saturation glass — the *total* of these small things is what reads as "Apple".

## Interaction foundations (reason with these names, beyond the visual)

- **Wayfinding — every screen answers four questions:** Where am I? Where can I go? What's there? How do I get out? Never trap the user.
- **Feedback comes in four kinds:** status, completion, warning, error. Validate inline, not on submit; expose ongoing status.
- **Grouping & mapping.** Place a control next to what it affects; arrange controls to mirror what they change. If a control needs a label to be understood, the mapping is weak.
- **Agency & forgiveness.** Easy undo beats confirmation dialogs; reserve confirmations for genuinely destructive, irreversible actions (overuse trains click-through).
- **Direct, specific labels beat safe generic ones.** "Progress" / "Library", not "Home". Specificity creates predictability.

## Two modes

- **Build** — making new UI. Follow the workflow below.
- **Review** — auditing existing CSS / a page / a component for "is this Apple / make it consistent". Use `review.md` (find the real visual surface → score against the system → prioritized findings → fix toward the tokens). The biggest wins are usually one off-system theme file that everything renders through.

## Workflow — Build mode (follow in order)

1. **Read `design-system.md`** — the full spec (color, type, spacing, radius, shadow, glass recipe, components, responsive).
2. **Drop in `tokens.css`** — the `:root` custom properties. Reference everything via `var(--…)`; never hard-code raw hex/px that a token already names.
3. **Pick a page recipe from `patterns.md`** — container (720 read / 1080 grid), archetype (detail / index / home / form), and run its decision trees (panel vs cards, glass vs solid, color vs grayscale).
4. **Compose from `components.md`** — copy the proven snippets (nav, unified panel list, card/grid, segmented pill, tag, button, colored CTA, live dot). Adapt content, keep structure + tokens.
5. **If it's an App / iOS screen** (mobile mockup, app 原型, anything inside a phone) — **read `app.md`** for the mobile shell the core files don't ship: device frame (exact iPhone spec — never hand-roll the island/status bar/home indicator), large-title-collapse nav, tab bar, edge-anchored bottom sheet, safe areas, touch targets. The *content* still comes from `components.md`; `app.md` is only the shell around it, and the same rules hold (unified panels, glass-on-overlap, grayscale + one accent, no color-by-status on list values). **Needs icons** (tab bar, object-type rows, actions)? Read `icons.md` — the line-icon layer (curated Lucide inline set, one 24-grid stroke, grayscale `currentColor`, accent only on action/active, and the restraint rules so icons earn their place — no grey squares, no emoji).
6. **If the UI has interactive layers** (dialog / sheet / popover / drawer / anything summoned & dismissed) — **read `motion.md`** and apply the fluid-motion treatment: pointer-down feedback, spring-like easing tokens, same-path enter/exit, materialize (blur+scale+opacity together), interruptibility, and the three reduced-* media queries. Static content keeps the tiny motion budget.
7. **Check against `reference.html`** — open it; your output must look like it belongs on the same page. If a screenshot diverges, fix toward the reference.
8. **Run the gate** — `checklist.md` (or the condensed self-check below) before claiming done; interactive layers also pass the motion self-check at the end of `motion.md`; App screens pass the App self-check at the end of `app.md`.

> Portable: these files assume **no framework**. In React/Vue/etc., translate the CSS to your styling system but keep the *exact* token values, the panel-not-cards pattern, and the glass-only-on-overlap rule. Match the visual output; don't copy structure that doesn't fit.

## Anti-slop — what makes it NOT Apple (avoid every one)

- ❌ **Fragmented cards**: each item with its own border + tint + colored left-bar. → one panel + hairlines.
- ❌ **Glass everywhere**: blurring plain content blocks. → glass only on nav/overlay/CTA.
- ❌ **Color as decoration**: tinted backgrounds, multi-color, rainbow gradients washing the page. → grayscale body, one accent.
- ❌ **Generic fonts** (Inter/Roboto/Arial as the brand face). → system SF / PingFang stack, negative tracking on titles.
- ❌ **Warm cream / beige / kraft "paper"** ground — the over-used AI look. → cool `#f5f5f7`.
- ❌ **Purple-gradient-on-white** hero, hard black borders, heavy single drop-shadows, emoji confetti, "in today's fast-paced world" filler.
- ❌ **Even, timid spacing**: everything equally padded. → intentional whitespace, sections breathe (`clamp(34px,6vw,56px)`), panels short or tall as needed.
- ❌ Numbers/stats added to look "data-rich". → only numbers that carry meaning, in `tabular-nums`.

## Self-check (gate before "done")
- [ ] Ground `#f5f5f7` (cool), content on `#fff` surfaces, container centered (`max-width` 720 reading / 1080 grid).
- [ ] Sibling items use **one panel + hairline** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.07)`), not fragmented cards.
- [ ] Glass appears **only** on nav / overlay / CTA. Plain blocks are solid white + soft shadow.
- [ ] Big titles have **negative letter-spacing**; long body line-height ≥ 1.85; numbers `tabular-nums`.
- [ ] Radius + shadow taken from the **named token tiers**, not ad-hoc values.
- [ ] Accent color is blue / heat-orange / brand only — everything else grayscale.
- [ ] Layout uses flex/grid + `gap` (not inline + margin); touch targets ≥ 44px; `clamp()` for responsive; mobile collapses to one column, secondary info hidden.
- [ ] Removed avoidable noise (extra icons, stats, decoration, emoji).
- [ ] Visually matches `reference.html`.
